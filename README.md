# Riddles!
This is a team project to make website using Node.js. We made a riddle website that you can post and answer riddle. Also you can edit and delete riddle.  
We made CRUD function using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas to manage riddle and comment. For front end side, we used ejs that is Embedded JavaScript templating language to show data.
